# Hello friend - I'm Jeremiah  

I am just another millennial Windows System Administrator navigating this crazy world. Currently based in Minnesota (USA), where the winters plunge to -20&deg;F (-29&deg;C) and the summers go to 85&deg;F (30&deg;C).  

When I'm not wrangling servers, you'll find me immersed in books, pounding the pavement on a run, biking in the urban environment, or indulging in the ultimate risk: eating raw cookie dough. 
Music fuels my soul, and helping others keeps me grounded and motivated.

In my professional life, I'm all about maintaining Azure Virtual Desktop, optimizing our Modern Device Management with Intune, and crafting automations (especially with PowerShell).

Thanks for dropping by, and I hope your day is as wonderful as can be!
