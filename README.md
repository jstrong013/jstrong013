# Hello new friend - I'm Jeremiah  

I am just another millennial Windows System Administrator trying to get by in this crazy world. Currently, I reside 
in Minnesota (USA) where the winters get to -20&deg;F (-29&deg;C) and the summers go to 85&deg;F (30&deg;C).  

I enjoy books, running, hiking, and eating raw cookie dough. What can I say, I am a risk taker! Music and helping others 
is what keeps me inspired and alive in this world.  

For work, I maintain Windows Servers, create automations (primarily with PowerShell), and occasionally fix the toughest technology known to mankind (printers).  

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you have a wonderful day!
